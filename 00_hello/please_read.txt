Hello!!

My Name is Sauronil Das, who took up your course on C programming. 

If any admin is readinf this file, can you please edit the vimrc file on home directory as follows:

filetype plugin on
filetype indent on
syntax enable

" TAB character as source code instead of 4 spaces(it is generally default setting, but for extra defensive mechanism for Makefiles and other indentation errors
" set softtabstop=0 noexpandtab


set expandtab "Converts a TAB character to Spaces

set smarttab "A backspace will delete shiftwidth worth of space

set shiftwidth = 4 "One TAB is 4 spaces Long

set tabstop = 4 "The width of a hard tabstop measured in spaces -- effectively the (maximum) 
        width of an actual tab character.

set softtabstop = 0 "Setting this to a non-zero value other than tabstop will 
        make the tab key (in insert mode) insert a combination of spaces (and possibly tabs) to simulate tab stops at this width.
